# My Workout Tracker

## Description 
This application is utilized to track and record your workouts. You can add a completely new workout off the bat and check your metrics on the dashboard page. If you want to add to your existing workout then you can use the form to append and grow your stats for a given day. 

## Live Site
[My Workout Tracker](https://secret-plateau-60121.herokuapp.com/?id=5fa74c03caa98f0017819e5c)

## Usage
When you open the site you'll be greeted by an entry page showing your latest workout with all the stats that have been inputted so far. On the navbar you'll find a directory to the dashboard where it will show you your current stats for the weeks workout. If you hit the logo you'll be redirected back to the homepage where you can add to your current workout or add a new workout with the two buttons below your stats. If you choose to add a new workout you'll select what type of workout it was, either resistance or cardio, then enter in the specifics through the form provided. When you complete it then you can click the add button to add it, from there you can add more or complete the workout with the complete button.

## Challenges
The largest challenge for this project was getting the update workout working, the put api was very specific and it was a bit difficult to understand

## Credits 
We have the bootcamp code provided to us and the help of the instructor and Ta's to get this app off the ground.
